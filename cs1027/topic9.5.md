# Testing and Debugging

* errors: compiler errors (syntax), runtime errors, logic errors

## Compiler Errors
* **syntax error:** error in usage of Java, caught by compiler, cannot be run
* **syntax warning:** warning message generated by compiler, can run
* eg. semicolon, brackets, redeclaring var
* they are cumulative, getting rid of one can get rid of multiple

## Runtime Errors
* **runtime error:** program runs but gets ```exception``` error message; program may terminate
* eg. program bugs, bad input, hardware/software problems
* eg. null reference, array index out of bounds, run out of memory

## Logic Errors
* **logic error:** program runs but results are incorrect
* eg. incorrect algorithm, incorrect usage of operators

## Testing vs Debugging
* **testing:** identify any problems before software put to usage
* **debugging:** locating bugs (in testing or user of software) and fixing them
