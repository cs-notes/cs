# Topic 17: Analysis of Algorithms
* time complexity expresses relationship between size of input and execution time for algorithm

## Big-O: Formal Definition
* time complexity T(n) of an algorithm is O(f(n))

## Different Cases
* **worst case:** considers max of time over all inputs of size n; find upper bound on algorithm performance
* **average case:** considers average of time over all inputs of size n; determines average (expected) performance
* **best case:** considers min of time over all inputs of size n

## Intractable Problems
* **intractable:** solving it by computer is impractical
* algorithms with time complexity O(2^n) take too long to solve even for moderate values of n
