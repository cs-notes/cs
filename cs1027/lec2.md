# Collections
* a group of items we wish to treat as conceptual unit
  * eg. stack, queue, list, tree, graph

## Linear vs. Nonlinear collections
* **linear:** has predeccessor and successor
* **nonlinear:** hierarchical, graph,

## Abstraction
* separates the purpose of an entity from its implementation
* way to deal with complexity of large systems
* think of what we want to do with collection, independent of how it is done
* **interface:** *what* we need to do
* **implmentation:** *how* it is coded

## Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
* **data type:** set of values and operations defined on the values
* **abstract data type:** colleciton of data together with the set of operations on the data
* **data structure:** contruct within programming langugae, used to implement collection
