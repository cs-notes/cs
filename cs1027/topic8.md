# Topic 8: Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms
* software quality: efficient use of computer resources (CPU time, memory usage)

## Time Complexity
* based on *problem size* and *key operations*
* **growth function:** t(n) gets larger as n increases

## Big-O Notation
* **asymptotic complexity:** how the function grows as n increases
  * determined by the **dominant term** (the term that increases the quickest as n increases)
  * referred to as the *order of the algorithm*
