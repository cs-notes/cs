# Topic 11: Recursion

* **recursion:** defining something in terms of itself
  * uses word or concept being defined in the definition itself
  * base case that's defined, w/o self reference
* alternative to iteration (repetition, as in loop)  

## How Recursion Works
* when method is called, *call frame* is set up
* call frame pushed to *runtime stack*
* same thing when a method calls itself

## Recursive Solutions
* quick sort
* backtracking problems in AI
* formal language definitions
* evaluating algebraic expressions in postfix form
* towers of Hanoi
